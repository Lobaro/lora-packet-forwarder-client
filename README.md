# LoRa Packet Forwarder Client

Enables communication with the [LoRa Packet Forarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder) from Semtech.

The code is based on the [TTN LoRa Gateway Bridge](https://github.com/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge) but targets a more generic aproach to talk to the Gateway, e.g. you can receive packets with wrong CRC.
